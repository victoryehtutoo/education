Removes href from all links to hide hover URL and keeps them clickable via JavaScript.

I know most WordPress developers face the same issue as I did. Hiding the URL link on hover is a painful job, especially when using page builders like Elementor. So I created this plugin to help others who need a simple solution. This plugin removes the hover URL preview while keeping the links functional, making your design cleaner and more professional.
